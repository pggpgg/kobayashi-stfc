//! Genetic algorithm optimizer for large crew search spaces.
//! Described in DESIGN.md and README; not yet wired into the main optimization flow in `optimizer::mod`.
//! The active path is `CrewGenerator` → `run_monte_carlo` → `rank_results`.

/// Placeholder for genetic-algorithm-based crew search. When implemented, will evolve
/// crew combinations for large below-decks / full roster spaces where exhaustive search is infeasible.
pub fn run_genetic() {
    // Placeholder implementation.
